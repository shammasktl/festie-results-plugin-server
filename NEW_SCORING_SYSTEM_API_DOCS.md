# Festie Results Extension - Updated Scoring System API Documentation

## Base URL
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## Overview
This API provides endpoints for managing events, participants (candidates), results, and user authentication for the Festie Results Extension with an **updated scoring system (1-11)**.

---

## üèÜ New Scoring System (1-11)

The scoring system has been updated to provide more granular control over position and grade assignments:

### Score-to-Position-Grade Mapping

| Score | Position | Grade | Description |
|-------|----------|-------|-------------|
| **11** | 1st Place | A | First place with A grade |
| **10** | 2nd Place | A | Second place with A grade |
| **9** | 3rd Place | A | Third place with A grade |
| **8** | None | A | A grade without specific position |
| **7** | 1st Place | B | First place with B grade |
| **6** | 2nd Place | B | Second place with B grade |
| **5** | 3rd Place | B | Third place with B grade |
| **4** | None | B | B grade without specific position |
| **3** | 1st Place | None | First place without grade |
| **2** | 2nd Place | None | Second place without grade |
| **1** | 3rd Place | None | Third place without grade |

### Key Features
- **Flexible Grading**: Separate A and B grade tracks with positions
- **Grade-Only Awards**: Scores 8 and 4 for recognition without position
- **Position-Only Awards**: Scores 3, 2, 1 for ranking without grade
- **Enhanced Scoring Range**: 1-11 scale provides more nuanced results
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing APIs work with new scoring system

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "eventId": "summer_music_festival_123456_ab3d",

  }
}
```

**Strategic Logic with New Scoring System:**
- **Raise Team Strategy**: Prioritizes programs where the target team has high scores (9-11)
- **Lower Team Strategy**: Prioritizes programs where other teams have high scores, limiting the target team's advantage
- **Score Impact**: Higher scores (11, 10, 9) have more strategic value than lower scores
- **Team Ranking**: Uses total accumulated scores from published programs

## üìù Complete Workflow Example with New Scoring System

### End-to-End Example Using 1-11 Scoring

**üìå Note:** Event IDs are automatically generated by the server. Use the `eventId` returned in the create event response for all subsequent requests.

1. **Create user account and login** (same as before)

2. **Create event with auto-generated ID:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Advanced Talent Festival 2024"
  }'
```

3. **Add teams:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/event/{GENERATED_EVENT_ID}/teams \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "teams": [
      {
        "name": "Team Alpha",
        "description": "Advanced performance team"
      },
      {

        "description": "Creative arts team"
      },
      {
        "name": "Team Gamma",
        "description": "Traditional arts team"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/event/{GENERATED_EVENT_ID}/candidates \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{

## üîß Migration Guide

### Changes from Old System (8,7,6,5) to New System (1-11)

**Old System Mapping:**
- Score 8 = 1st Place A grade
- Score 7 = 1st Place B grade
- Score 6 = 2nd Place B grade  
- Score 5 = 3rd Place B grade

**New System Mapping:**
- Score 11 = 1st Place A grade
- Score 10 = 2nd Place A grade
- Score 9 = 3rd Place A grade
- Score 8 = A grade only
- Score 7 = 1st Place B grade
- Score 6 = 2nd Place B grade
- Score 5 = 3rd Place B grade
- Score 4 = B grade only
- Score 3 = 1st Place only
- Score 2 = 2nd Place only
- Score 1 = 3rd Place only

### API Compatibility
- ‚úÖ All existing endpoints work with new scoring system
- ‚úÖ Existing data is preserved and continues to work
- ‚úÖ New scoring features are additive, not breaking
- ‚úÖ Enhanced validation provides better error messages

### Key Improvements
1. **More Granular Control**: Separate A and B grade tracks
2. **Flexible Recognition**: Grade-only and position-only awards
3. **Enhanced Range**: 1-11 scale for more precise scoring
4. **Better Strategic Planning**: More sophisticated team ranking strategies
5. **Improved Documentation**: Comprehensive examples and error handling

9     | 3rd      | A     | Good performance, high grade
8     | None     | A     | High grade recognition only
7     | 1st      | B     | Top performer with good grade
6     | 2nd      | B     | Good performance, good grade
5     | 3rd      | B     | Decent performance, good grade
